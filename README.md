# Spotify Song Guessing Game (needs better name I know)
Just a little song guessing game.
Instead of being totally random, or being sorted by genre which is still way too broad in my opinion, this game uses your own Spotify playlists.
You will get two times, one for how much time has passed listening to the song, and one for how long you take to guess the song.

# TODO:
- Randomly pick a song
- Start timer when song starts
- Start timer when guess starts
- Make a landing page after selecting a playlist, but before starting to guess, explaining the game
